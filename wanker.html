    Dear Debbie,

    Where do I even begin? I suppose saying “I’m sorry” is a start.

    I’m sorry.

    Looking back, I can’t believe that I called you a scammer.  But I suppose hindsight is always 20/20. It was stupid and I wasn’t the friend that you expected me to be. Even if I explain my actions, it still doesn’t justify that I said some pretty hurtful things.

    I hope you can forgive me for what I did and put this matter behind us. I treasure our friendship and all the things we’ve done and been through. And hopefully, what transpired can become one of those incidents that make our bond stronger than ever.

    If you have anything on your mind regarding this, please feel free to share it. I promise to listen before I speak. It’s the least I could do if you’re willing to forgive me. You know how to contact me. I hope you do.

    Your friend,
    Dieter
 </p>
